### Exercise 2.17<a name="Exercise2_17">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with creating a procedure `last-pair` and returns a list containing the last element of the list. It canbe done as follows:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (last-pair items)
  (if (null? (cdr items))
      items
	  (last-pair (cdr items))))
; last-pair

(last-pair (list 23 72 149 34))
; (34)
(last-pair (list 23 72 149 (list 34 45)))
; ((34 45))
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 2.18<a name="Exercise2_18">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with writing a procedure `reverse` which can be used to convert a list to another list with the same elements in reverse order. It can be done with the assistance of the `append` function given in the book.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (append list1 list2)
  (if (null? list1)
      list2
      (cons (car list1) 
            (append (cdr list1) 
                    list2))))
; append

(define (reverse items)
  (if (null? (cdr items))
      items
      (append (reverse (cdr items))
              (list (car items)))))
; reverse

(reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
; (25 16 9 4 1)
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 2.19<a name="Exercise2_19">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with rewriting the change-counting program in Section 1.2.2 so that they can be used on arbitrary currency by allowing the denominations to be specified as a list. We are given the folowing function `cc`:-

{% highlight scheme %}


(define (cc amount coin-values)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 
         1)
        ((or (< amount 0) 
             (no-more? coin-values)) 
         0)
        (else
         (+ (cc 
             amount
             (except-first-denomination 
              coin-values))
            (cc 
             (- amount
                (first-denomination 
                 coin-values))
             coin-values)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We are tasked with writing the procedures `first-denomination`, `except-first-denomination` and `no-more?` to complete the procedure. Let us do that and test the function.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define first-denomination car)
(define except-first-denomination cdr)
(define no-more? null?)

(define us-coins 
  (list 50 25 10 5 1))
; us-coins
(define uk-coins 
  (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
; uk-coins

(cc 100 us-coins)
; 292
(cc 100 uk-coins)
; 104561
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that our solution gives the same right answer as before.

Further, we are asked if the order of the list `coin-values` affect the answer produced by `cc` or not. The answer is that it should not affect the answer. This is because our current algorithm checks all coin combinations irrespective of their denomination order. Let us test it.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define us-coins-scr (list 10 25 1 50 5))
; us-coins-scr
(cc 100 us-coins-scr)
; 292
{% endhighlight %}

As we can see, the same answer is obtained.

### Exercise 2.20<a name="Exercise2_20">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with using the *dotted-tail notation* to define a procedure `same-parity` which can be used to return a list of all arguments that has the same even-odd parity as the first argument.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (same-parity head . tail)
  (let ((rem (remainder head 2)))
    (define (filter-even-odd items)
      (if (null? items)
        items
		(if (= (remainder (car items) 2) rem)
            (cons (car items)
                  (filter-even-odd (cdr items)))
	        (filter-even-odd (cdr items)))))
    (cons head (filter-even-odd tail))))
; same-parity

(same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
; (1 3 5 7)
(same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
; (2 4 6)
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 2.21<a name="Exercise2_21">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with creating a procedure `square-list` by filling the missing expressions in the given procedures. The two procedures perform the operation directly and using `map` respectively. W

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (square (car items)) (square-list (cdr items)))))
; square-list

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
; (1 4 9 16)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (square-list items)
  (map square items))
; square-list

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
; (1 4 9 16)
{% endhighlight %}

As can be seen, both definitions give the same correct answer. However, the second case would be a better definition because of its simplicity.

### Exercise 2.22<a name="Exercise2_22">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with determining why the `square-list` procedure written by Louis Reasoner does not exactly give the right answer.

##### Original code

The first iteration of the `square-list` procedure is as follows.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items nil))
; square-list

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
; (16 9 4 1)
{% endhighlight %}

As can be seen, we get the expected result, but in reverse. To see how this happens, let us expand the evaluation.

{% highlight scheme %}
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))

(iter (list 1 2 3 4) nil)

(iter (list 2 3 4) (cons 1 nil))

(iter (list 3 4) (cons 4 (cons 1 nil)))

(iter (list 4) (cons 9 (cons 4 (cons 1 nil))))

(iter nil (cons 16 (cons 9 (cons 4 (cons 1 nil)))))

(cons 16 (cons 9 (cons 4 (cons 1 nil))))

(16 9 4 1)
{% endhighlight %}

Thus, to fix this reversal, Louis tries to switch the arguement to `cons`.

##### Reversed code

Let us look at the reversed code and its execution.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square 
                     (car things))))))
  (iter items nil))
; square-list

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
; ((((() . 1) . 4) . 9) . 16)
{% endhighlight %}

Now the values appear in the right order but the lists appear wonky. Let us see why.

{% highlight scheme %}
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))

(iter (list 1 2 3 4) nil)

(iter (list 2 3 4) (cons nil 1))

(iter (list 3 4) (cons (cons nil 1) 4))

(iter (list 4) (cons (cons (cons nil 1) 4) 9))

(iter nil (cons (cons (cons (cons nil 1) 4) 9) 16))

(cons (cons (cons (cons nil 1) 4) 9) 16)

((((() . 1) . 4) . 9) . 16)
{% endhighlight %}

Thus, we can see that this doesn't work either because putting `nil` in the `car` position does not make it vanish.

##### Fixed code

Since we have the things in the right order, we can use our old friend `append` to make things appear as they should.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (append answer
                    (list (square (car things)))))))
  (iter items nil))
; square-list

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
; (1 4 9 16)
{% endhighlight %}

Thus, we have the right answer by eliminating the `nil` in the wrong places and flattening the list at each iteration.

### Exercise 2.23<a name="Exercise2_23">&nbsp;</a>

We are asked to implement a procedure called `for-each` in this exercise. This procedure takes a procedure and a list. The procedure does not evaluate to anything but simply perform an action. It can be done using the following code.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (for-each f items)
  (if (null? items)
      #t
      (begin (f (car items))
             (for-each f (cdr items)))))
; for-each

(for-each f (list 57 321 88))
; 57
; 321
; 88
; #t
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `begin` is used to sequence the operations so that they can be executed together.
