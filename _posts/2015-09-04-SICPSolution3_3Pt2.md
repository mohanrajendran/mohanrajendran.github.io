### Exercise 3.15<a name="Exercise3_15">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with explaining the difference in behavior when a function `set-to-wow!` is applied to two seemingly similar lists:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (set-to-wow! x)
  (set-car! (car x) 'wow)
  x)

(define x (list 'a 'b))
(define z1 (cons x x))
(define z2 
  (cons (list 'a 'b) (list 'a 'b)))

z1
; ((a b) a b)
z2
; ((a b) a b)

(set-to-wow! z1)
; ((wow b) wow b)
(set-to-wow! z2)
; ((wow b) a b)
{% endhighlight %}

<!--excerpt-->

Even though *z1* and *z2* looked the same initially, calling `set-to-wow!` on them produces different results. They can be explained by the following box and pointer diagrams resulting from the application:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_15.svg" alt="After application of set-to-wow!"/>
</center>

As can be seen, both `car` and `cdr` of *z1* point to the same object. Thus, mutating one changes the other. As for *z2*, we had two exact same copies pointing to same elements down the road. Calling `set-to-wow!` on this only modified one copy, leaving the other alone.

### Exercise 3.16<a name="Exercise3_16">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are told to examine the following `count-pairs` function written by Ben Bitdiddle:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (count-pairs x)
  (if (not (pair? x))
      0
      (+ (count-pairs (car x))
	 (count-pairs (cdr x))
	 1)))
{% endhighlight %}
	 
On the outset, we can see that this function will not work correctly because it does not consider pairs that might be pointed to from more than one location. They will be counted more than once. We have seen such cases in the previous exercises. Let us construct cases each with three pairs which give the required answers.

#### 3 pairs

This list can be constructed simply by a linear list which yields the following structure:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_16_3Pairs.svg" alt="Evaluate to 3 pairs"/>
</center>

{% highlight scheme %}
(define w '(a b c))

(count-pairs w)
; 3
{% endhighlight %}

As can be seen, in this simple case, the algorithm gives the right answer.

#### 4 pairs
	
This list can be constructed as follows:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_16_4Pairs.svg" alt="Evaluate to 4 pairs"/>
</center>

When evaluated, *x1* is counted twice and yields 4.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define x2 (cons x1 'c))
(define x (cons x1 x2))

(count-pairs x)
; 4
{% endhighlight %}

#### 7 pairs

This list can be constructed as follows:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_16_7Pairs.svg" alt="Evaluate to 7 pairs"/>
</center>

In this case, *y2* is counted twice and *y1* is counted 4 times to yield 7.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define y1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define y2 (cons y1 y1))
(define y (cons y2 y2))

(count-pairs y)
; 7 
{% endhighlight %}

#### Unlimited pairs

This list can be constructed by introducing a cycle:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_13_Pointer.svg" alt="Evaluate to unlimited pairs"/>
</center>

The code would keep evaluating along the cycle and never return at all.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define z (make-cycle '(a b c)))

(count-pairs z)
; Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded
{% endhighlight %}



### Exercise 3.17<a name="Exercise3_17">&nbsp;</a>
	
In this exercise, we are required to create a correct version of `create-pairs` which returns the correct number of distinct pairs. One good way to do it is to maintain a list of pairs already encountered and only count pairs not seen before. One way is as follows:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (count-pairs x)
  (define encountered '())
  (define (count-unique-pairs x)
    (if (and (pair? x)
	     (not (memq x encountered)))
	(begin (set! encountered (cons x encountered))
	       (+ (count-unique-pairs (car x))
		  (count-unique-pairs (cdr x))
		  1))
	0))
  (count-unique-pairs x))
{% endhighlight %}

Let us test it on the lists defined in the previous exercise:-

{% highlight scheme %}
w
; (a b c)
(count-pairs w)
; 3

x
; ((a . b) (a . b) . c)
(count-pairs x)
; 3

y
; (((a . b) a . b) (a . b) a . b)
(count-pairs y)
; 3

(count-pairs z)
; 3
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 3.18<a name="Exercise3_18">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with implementing a procedure that determines if a list contains a cycle. It is given that a list with cycle is defined as one that would result in an infinite loop if successive `cdr` is invoked on it. We can use the code from the previous exercise which tracks the pairs seen already to perform this check:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (has-cycle? x)
  (define encountered '())
  (define (check-if-seen x)
    (cond ((not (pair? x)) #f)
	      ((memq x encountered) #t)
	      (else (begin (set! encountered (cons x encountered))
		               (check-if-seen (cdr x))))))
  (check-if-seen x))
{% endhighlight %}

Let us go ahead and test this code on the cases from before. Only *z* should result in true:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(has-cycle? w)
; #f

(has-cycle? x)
; #f

(has-cycle? y)
; #f

(has-cycle? z)
; #t
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 3.19<a name="Exercise3_19">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with re-implementing the `has-cycle?` code from the previous exercise so that only constant space is required. It can be implemented using [Floyd's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Tortoise_and_hare). 

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (has-cycle? x)
  (define (safe-cdr x)
    (if (pair? x)
	(cdr x)
	'()))
  (define (safe-cddr x)
    (safe-cdr (safe-cdr x)))
  (define (advance-pointer t h)
    (cond ((null? h) #f)
	  ((eq? t h) #t)
	  (else (advance-pointer
		 (safe-cdr t)
		 (safe-cddr h)))))
  (advance-pointer x (safe-cdr x)))
{% endhighlight %}

With this, let us test the cases from before:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(has-cycle? w)
; #f

(has-cycle? x)
; #f

(has-cycle? y)
; #f

(has-cycle? z)
; #t

(has-cycle? (cons 'd z))
; #t
{% endhighlight %}


### Exercise 3.20<a name="Exercise3_20">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are tasked with giving the environment diagrams when the following code is executed:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (cons x y)
  (define (set-x! v) (set! x v))
  (define (set-y! v) (set! y v))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) x)
          ((eq? m 'cdr) y)
          ((eq? m 'set-car!) set-x!)
          ((eq? m 'set-cdr!) set-y!)
          (else (error "Undefined 
                 operation: CONS" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (car z) (z 'car))
(define (cdr z) (z 'cdr))

(define (set-car! z new-value)
  ((z 'set-car!) new-value)
  z)

(define (set-cdr! z new-value)
  ((z 'set-cdr!) new-value)
  z)

(define x (cons 1 2))
(define z (cons x x))

(set-car! (cdr z) 17)

(car x)
17
{% endhighlight %}

Initially, when the definition for `cons`, `car`, `cdr`, `set-car!` and `set-cdr!` is set up, the environment looks like the following:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_20_Step1.svg" alt="After definition of cons"/>
</center>

Next, defining *x* and *z* sets up the following:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_20_Step2.svg" alt="After defining x and z"/>
</center>

When we call `(cdr z)` we evaluate to *x*. Then, calling `set-car!` on that alters the value of *x* in environment *E1* to 17 as follows:-

<center>
<img src="/images/Ex3_20_Step3.svg" alt="After calling set-car"/>
</center>

We have skipped evaluation of `cdr` and `set-car!` to drill down to the lower levels. Finally, evaluating in *E5* sets the value of *x* in *E1* to 17.
