	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		I'm Mohan Rajendran, a Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon based in the Seattle area. I've spent several years building large-scale distributed systems—from serverless architectures to ML-powered platforms that serve millions of customers and handle high-volume traffic.
	</p>

	<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
	<p>
		Currently at Amazon Photos, I focus on:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Data Pipelines</strong> - Building scalable data processing systems that handle massive volumes</li>
		<li><strong>GenAI Applications</strong> - Integrating generative AI into production systems</li>
		<li><strong>Cloud Migration</strong> - Leading initiatives to modernize infrastructure</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Previously, I was part of the founding team for Sponsored Products' Product Attribute Targeting, where I built the infrastructure and data systems that power advertising features across Amazon's marketplace.
	</p>

	<h2>Career Journey</h2>
	<p>
		Before Amazon, I worked in the energy sector at Bluware and Schlumberger, building geoscience platforms and real-time drilling automation systems. These experiences taught me how to build reliable systems in high-stakes environments.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Education:</strong> M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering (Georgia Tech), B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering (MIT Chennai)
	</p>

	<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Languages & Frameworks:</strong> Java, Scala, Python, TypeScript<br>
		<strong>Cloud & Infrastructure:</strong> AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Kinesis, Step Functions), Apache Spark<br>
		<strong>Specializations:</strong> Distributed systems, data pipelines, ML/AI integration, serverless architectures
	</p>

	<h2>Why I Write</h2>
	<p>
		I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge. This blog is where I document technical explorations, share lessons learned from building production systems, and work through computer science fundamentals. Whether I'm solving SICP exercises or architecting distributed systems, writing helps solidify my understanding and hopefully helps others along the way.
	</p>

	<h2>Let's Connect</h2>
	<p>
		I'm always interested in connecting with fellow engineers, discussing system design challenges, or exploring new technologies. Find me on:
