			<h1>Building Systems, Sharing Knowledge</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Mohan Rajendran, a Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I build large-scale distributed systems, work with GenAI applications, and solve complex problems in cloud infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is where I share what I learn. You'll find technical deep-dives, solutions to challenging problems, and my journey through computer science fundamentals. I believe in learning in public—documenting both successes and lessons learned along the way.
			</p>

			<h2>Current Focus</h2>
			<p>
				At Amazon Photos, I'm working on data pipelines, GenAI applications, and cloud migration initiatives. Previously, I was part of the founding team building infrastructure and data systems for Sponsored Products' Product Attribute Targeting—systems that handle high-volume traffic and serve millions of customers.
