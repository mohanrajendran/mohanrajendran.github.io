### Exercise 3.38<a id="Exercise3_38">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are given three events acting on an initial `balance` of 100:-

1. Peter: `(set! balance (+ balance 10))`
2. Paul: `(set! balance (- balance 20))`
3. Mary: `(set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2)))`

When these events might be run sequntally in an arbitrary order, the following values of `balance` might be produced:-

- Peter, Paul, Mary :- 100 -> 110 -> 90 -> 45
- Peter, Mary, Paul :- 100 -> 110 -> 55 -> 35
- Paul, Peter, Mary :- 100 -> 80 -> 90 -> 45
- Paul, Mary, Peter :- 100 -> 80 -> 40 -> 50
- Mary, Peter, Paul :- 100 -> 50 -> 60 -> 40
- Mary, Paul, Pater :- 100 -> 50 -> 30 -> 40

If the individual processes can be interleaved, many different values can be produced.

The above ordering can produce a final value of 80.

The above ordering can produce a final value of 110. These examples show us the importance of concurrency management.

### Exercise 3.39<a id="Exercise3_39">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are given the following serialized code:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute 
  (lambda () 
    (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We are asked what the possible values of `x` would be once the execution is complete. We can see there are three operations:-

1. `((s (lambda () (* x x))))`
2. `(set! x ...)`
3. `(s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))`

Since step **2** is dependant of **1** being complete, and **2** can interleave with **3**, we get the following permutations and results:-

* Steps 1, 2, 3 in order :- 10 -> 100 -> 101
* Steps 3, 1, 2 in order :- 10 -> 11 -> 121
* Steps 1, 3, 2 in order :- 10 -> 11 -> 100
* Step 1 first then Step 3 with Step 2 interleaved :- 10 -> 100 -> 11

### Exercise 3.40<a id="Exercise3_40">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are asked for possible values when the following code is evaluated:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute 
 (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
 (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
{% endhighlight %}

* 100 :- $$P_1$$ calculates 100, $$P_2$$ calculates 1000 and stores, $$P_1$$ stores 100
* 1000 :- $$P_2$$ calculates 1000, $$P_1$$ calculates 100 and stores, $$P_2$$ stores 1000
* 10000 :- $$P_1$$ reads first x as 10, $$P_2$$ calculates 1000 and stores, $$P_1$$ reads second x as 1000 and stores 10000
* 100000 :- $$P_2$$ reads first x as 10, $$P_1$$ calculates 100 and stores, $$P_2$$ reads second and third x as 100 and stores 100000
* 1000000 :- $$P_1$$ calculates 100 and stores, $$P_2$$ calculates 1000000 and stores

However, if we uses serialized procedures as follows:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute 
 (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))
 (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We can have $$P_1$$ and $$P_2$$ getting run atomically. Since the operation is commutative, we get 1000000 in both cases.

### Exercise 3.41<a id="Exercise3_41">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, Ben Bitdiddle replaces access to balance from `balance` to `(protected (lambda () balance))`. I think that this replacement is not required. This is mainly because accessing `balance` is a single operation. Thus we will not get any other operation interleaving with this access. Furthermore, mutations to `balance` is done using serialized methods and that ensures safe and consistent operations. Only place where interference might occur is when one tries to access `balance` in the middle of `withdraw` and `deposit` operations. This technically is not a faulty operation since we only consider the data to be mutated once these operations are over.

### Exercise 3.42<a id="Exercise3_42">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we have another change by Ben Bitdiddle, he changes `make-account` so that `dispatch` returns pre-protected functions instead of protecting function each time its accessed. This is a valid change since protection only comes into play when executing. When the protection is applied is immaterial.

### Exercise 3.43<a id="Exercise3_43">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we talk about exchanging balances between three accounts. Let us use the following code as an example:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((difference (- (account1 'balance)
                       (account2 'balance))))
    ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
    ((account2 'deposit) difference)))

(define a (make-account 10))
(define b (make-account 20))
(define c (make-account 30))

(parallel-execute
  (exchange a b)
  (exchange b c))
{% endhighlight %}

If we use the given code as follows and replace `exchange` above with `serialized-exchange` below:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (serialized-exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((serializer1 (account1 'serializer))
        (serializer2 (account2 'serializer)))
    ((serializer1 (serializer2 exchange))
     account1
     account2)))
{% endhighlight %}

we preserve the right balances because all involved accounts are serialized for the duration of exchange. No other process involving either account can be run while `serialized-exchange` being run. However, if we use the original `exchange` function, we obviously will get errors because execution can be interleaved between when a balance is computed and when balance is swapped. Let us demonstrate this by using the following diagram:-

![Exchange race condition](/images/Ex3_43.svg)

Though, we should end with 20/30/10, we end up with 20/20/20. This is because by the time actual swap is conducted, the `difference` amount to swap would not be valid anymore. However, since the amount withdrawn and deposited in any step is equal and each sub-operation is serialized, the total amount of balance would still be maintained.

### Exercise 3.44<a id="Exercise3_44">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are given the following code to transfer amounts between accounts:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define 
  (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
  ((to-account 'deposit) amount))
{% endhighlight %}

Ben Bitdiddle calins that the procedure works when many people transfer money concurrently and Louis Reasoner claims otherwise. I would agree with Ben. Since `withdraw` and `deposit` are serialized, there should not be any inconsistencies. Furthermore, the actual `amount` to transfer is held the same across withdrawal and deposit. This means that the intended effect is obtained.

A key difference between this and the previous exercise is that the value of `difference` migh be invalid before the transfer ever takes place. In this case, we are explicitly given the transfer amount. Thus no concurrency issues would arise.

### Exercise 3.45<a id="Exercise3_45">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are given a new version of `make-account-and-serializer` from Louis that serializes `withdraw` and `deposit` internally as well as exposes a serializer for use in transactions involving multiple accounts.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define 
  (make-account-and-serializer balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (let ((balance-serializer 
         (make-serializer)))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) 
             (balance-serializer withdraw))
            ((eq? m 'deposit) 
             (balance-serializer deposit))
            ((eq? m 'balance) 
             balance)
            ((eq? m 'serializer) 
             balance-serializer)
            (else (error "Unknown request: 
                          MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                         m))))
    dispatch))
{% endhighlight %}

The issue with this code is that when a combined transaction needs to perform `deposit` or `withdraw`, it would be locked out since the overall transaction would already have acquired the locks. For example, let us look at the `serialized-exhange` code again:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((difference (- (account1 'balance)
                       (account2 'balance))))
    ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
    ((account2 'deposit) difference)))

(define (serialized-exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((serializer1 (account1 'serializer))
        (serializer2 (account2 'serializer)))
    ((serializer1 (serializer2 exchange))
     account1
     account2)))
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, since the overall call to `exchange` is serialized with `serializer1` and `serializer2`, the internal calls would not be able to call `withdraw` and `deposit` since they require the serializers again. Thus, the call would have a [deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock).
