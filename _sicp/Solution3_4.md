### Exercise 3.38<a id="Exercise3_38">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are given three events acting on an initial `balance` of 100:-

1. Peter: `(set! balance (+ balance 10))`
2. Paul: `(set! balance (- balance 20))`
3. Mary: `(set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2)))`

When these events might be run sequntally in an arbitrary order, the following values of `balance` might be produced:-

- Peter, Paul, Mary :- 100 -> 110 -> 90 -> 45
- Peter, Mary, Paul :- 100 -> 110 -> 55 -> 35
- Paul, Peter, Mary :- 100 -> 80 -> 90 -> 45
- Paul, Mary, Peter :- 100 -> 80 -> 40 -> 50
- Mary, Peter, Paul :- 100 -> 50 -> 60 -> 40
- Mary, Paul, Pater :- 100 -> 50 -> 30 -> 40

If the individual processes can be interleaved, many different values can be produced.

The above ordering can produce a final value of 80.

![Possibility 2](/images/Ex3_38_Part2.svg)
-
The above ordering can produce a final value of 110. These examples show us the importance of concurrency management.

### Exercise 3.39<a id="Exercise3_39">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are given the following serialized code:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute 
  (lambda () 
    (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We are asked what the possible values of `x` would be once the execution is complete. We can see there are three operations:-

1. `((s (lambda () (* x x))))`
2. `(set! x ...)`
3. `(s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))`

Since step **2** is dependant of **1** being complete, and **2** can interleave with **3**, we get the following permutations and results:-

* Steps 1, 2, 3 in order :- 10 -> 100 -> 101
* Steps 3, 1, 2 in order :- 10 -> 11 -> 121
* Steps 1, 3, 2 in order :- 10 -> 11 -> 100
* Step 1 first then Step 3 with Step 2 interleaved :- 10 -> 100 -> 11

### Exercise 3.40<a id="Exercise3_40">&nbsp;</a>

In this exercise, we are asked for possible values when the following code is evaluated:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute 
 (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
 (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
{% endhighlight %}

* 100 :- $$P_1$$ calculates 100, $$P_2$$ calculates 1000 and stores, $$P_1$$ stores 100
* 1000 :- $$P_2$$ calculates 1000, $$P_1$$ calculates 100 and stores, $$P_2$$ stores 1000
* 10000 :- $$P_1$$ reads first x as 10, $$P_2$$ calculates 1000 and stores, $$P_1$$ reads second x as 1000 and stores 10000
* 100000 :- $$P_2$$ reads first x as 10, $$P_1$$ calculates 100 and stores, $$P_2$$ reads second and third x as 100 and stores 100000
* 1000000 :- $$P_1$$ calculates 100 and stores, $$P_2$$ calculates 1000000 and stores

However, if we uses serialized procedures as follows:-

{% highlight scheme %}
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute 
 (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))
 (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We can have $$P_1$$ and $$P_2$$ getting run atomically. Since the operation is commutative, we get 1000000 in both cases.
