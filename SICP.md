Also known as [SICP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). It is one of the most famous books in computer science and very essential for any software engineer to go through. In a series of blog posts, I shall be posting my comments and the solutions to the exercises as I work through them. This page curates the links to all the chapter summary and solutions. Online version of this book can be found at <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html>

To supplement the book, I will also be following the original online lectures by Abelson and Sussman found [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
