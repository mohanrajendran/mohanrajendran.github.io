Also known as [SICP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). It is one of the most famous books in computer science and very essential for any software engineer to go through. In a series of blog posts, I shall be posting the solutions to the exercises in the textbook as I work through them. This page curates the links to all the solutions. Online version of this book can be found at <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html>
